Updates to the framework:

CommonMethods.ClickOnCategoryMenu
The navbar on this website is called the category menu, I altered the code to make it work just as easily as the last. I also added ToUpperCase so that you do not need to worry about case sensitivity when selecting a module.

Pages:
I have created a page for each module and added them into the page intializer, most of them are empty and free for you to add whatever you need for your test cases.

Everything else should be very similar to our framework that we worked on in class to keep everything simple and familar. Good luck!
